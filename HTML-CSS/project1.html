      <ol>
            <li>This book has changed my view as a vegan meaning there are ways to make any food plant-based and allergy free. Even though I was a vegan, I always brought process foods from local food stores, supermarkets, etc. After learning how much nutrition facts and ingredients are put in vegan food meaning in-store mock/fake meat uses a lot of <b>sodium (salt)</b> and other ingredients I had no idea where it came from even though its certified vegan with its symbol. Now, I try to be careful to read and make sure all food are <b>ALL-NATURAL</b> and <b>PURE</b> or any other words like <b>ORGANIC</b> shown on products. Lastly, here is the vegan logo I look for all foods products before I buy them here are some examples below here:

            </li>
            <li>Another reason is it gave ideas to cook and also helped me understand how to build recipes and substitute which ingredients to use as a plant based diet eater (VEGAN). Like myself I been a vegeterian at first, but after that a long while ago, I become a vegan because of religious reasons since I am a buddhist for many years. Instead of using mock meat (gluten-flour) or process products that has a lot of calories and sodium rich ingredients, I took the time and learn how to cook like a vegan from this book. There are recipes and also alternatives to using plant based ingredients such as vegetables, nuts, and many more. In which it still has that meaty texture and flavor without harming any animals. Here are some of the image below that looks YUMMY and made with veggies, nuts, and other goodies.</li>

                        </li>
            <li>My final reason is that it help me changed my lifestyle in what I eat. Since I like to cook and also eat new things. I like to experiment and test out different things to make it simple for a person like myself who is all planet-based and also a vegan. This book changed my outlook in food and makes me want to grasp more knowledge in receipes in veganism meaning since I cannot eat anything that comes from an animal I know there are <b>TONS</b> of ways to make my own products. For example, soymilk or oatmilk, I usually buy them at a supermarket or store, but I like to make my own since I like to know what goes into making it. Because, making pure and organic means it has no perservatives and unknown chemicals like all products have in their foods.</li>
