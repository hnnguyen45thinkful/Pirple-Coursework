<h1 style="text-align: center;">Vegetarian (Vegan) West African Peanut Soup</h1>
<!-- Information about the food and created a paragraph tag <p>...</p> -->
<p>This recipe was unique because a peanut soup recipe from  West African sounds digusting and weird. But after eating this in a restaurant this was so creamy and comforting, and <b>LASTY</b>, this is a spicy vegan soup. With all vegetables and proteins your body needs made with a simple combination of peanut butter, tomato paste and collard greens, this soup comes together quickly and would be a great weekday meal in the evening or on a Sunday night. The reason I like this complex and confusing recipe is because I love bold and <b>SPICY</b> flavors <b>TONS</b> of amounts of ginger and garlic which has a savory smell.</p>
