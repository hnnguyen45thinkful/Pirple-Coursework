<!-- Information about the food and created a paragraph tag <p>...</p> -->
<p style = "font-size: 25px;">This recipe was unique because a peanut soup recipe from  West African sounds digusting and weird. But after eating this in a restaurant this was so creamy and comforting, and <b>LASTY</b>, this is a spicy vegan soup. With all vegetables and proteins your body needs made with a simple combination of peanut butter, tomato paste and collard greens, this soup comes together quickly and would be a great weekday meal in the evening or on a Sunday night. The reason I like this complex and confusing recipe is because I love bold and <b>SPICY</b> flavors <b>TONS</b> of amounts of ginger and garlic which has a savory smell.</p>

  <!-- Adding images and also a small paragragh about how good the food -->
  <p style = "font-size: 25px;">
    This is a whole hearty food to have in a cold weather or when you are sick. Because when I have a cough, cold or a flu I like to each a soup but like very spicy, so I can cough and spit out all the mucus and saliva stuck to my throat. Lastly, this is my go to meal I like to prep and cook after a long day at work or in the office.
